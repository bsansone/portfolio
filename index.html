<h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my website! My name is John Pindel. I graduated from NIU with a double bachelors in Philosophy
      and Computer Science. Currently I am a front end software engineer for Discover Financial Services.
      I mostly code in java, but as I am a front end developer I work on many aspects of web development such as REST servers,
      logging, ui, production fixes, and more. In my free time I like to travel and learn about outher cultures. I have been
      fascinated by the Japanese, and have been studing the language for a year and half now. So this website will be a combination
      of my work portfolio and my travels.
